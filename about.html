			<i class="name">Priyanshi Meghwani</i><br>
			She is responsible for designing all the looks and feel of the website.
			She was born and raised in Lucknow, India. She's now persuing B.Tech in CSE from BBDU where she had the good fortune to meet Shashwat and Satyam and start FOODSOME. Priyanshi gave name to this website. She designed and coded beautifully simple and fully responsive frontend for the site. When she is not working on all the punny-funny content displayed on the site, she blogs, solves puzzles or CTFs (trying to put a foot at the door of bug bounty) and can be found doing competitive coding, eating or working out (in order to eat more).
